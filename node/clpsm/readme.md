The greatest tool you _always_ knew you never needed. 'Cause fuck those shitty monetized sites that take 3 clicks and 700 http requests to get to some text that you copied into a _Slack_ snippet back in the _Snow Leopard_ days but never starred.   

Now all of your _"rock star"_ design needs are just a mainline **npm/webpack/mongo/MEAN/react** speedball away. Just make sure your terminal is running the latest version of [Bootstrap](https://giphy.com/gifs/tqKjGPAgbNVPq/html5) and supports [4k textures](http://media.kotaku.foxtrot.future.net.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2016/11/ac2.jpg).   
    
Nah, jk.. it just:   
`npm install clpsm`

# CLIPBOARD + LOREM IPSUM   
   
The greatest tool you _always_ knew you never needed. 'Cause fuck those shitty monetized sites that take 3 clicks and 700 http requests to get to some text that you copied into a _Slack_ snippet back in the _Snow Leopard_ days but never starred.   

Now all of your _"rock star"_ design needs are just a mainline **npm/webpack/mongo/drungus/react** speedball away. Just make sure your terminal is running the latest version of [Bootstrap](https://giphy.com/gifs/tqKjGPAgbNVPq/html5) and supports [4k textures](http://media.kotaku.foxtrot.future.net.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/52/2016/11/ac2.jpg).   
    
Nah, jk.. it has 1 dependency.

npm install clpsm -g`   # may need sudo
```   

# USE     

- Run w/ no arguement
```bash
$ clpsm    # single paragraph copied to clipboard, paste away
```

- Run w/ number arguement. _(Go as high as you want, it'll loop through 5 paragraphs)_
```bash

```
